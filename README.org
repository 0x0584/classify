* Introduction

  + This is a project that I did for the main reason, which is fun of course, why would you code anyway?

  + And the other reason is to /learn how to code in Perl/. I have always found that Perl is weird yet very interesting language with many useful built-in functionalities. 

  indeed, i was looking recently on many machine-learning related topics, such /text mining/, so here's where the idea of =classify= came from.

** Up and Running..
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   # in case of debug
   $ ./classify.pl -i docs/* -d dicts/* -t topics/* -g -s 0
  
   # normal case 
   $ ./classify.pl foo.txt -t top0.txt top1.txt
   #+END_SRC
